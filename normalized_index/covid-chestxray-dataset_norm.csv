Echo (image 2, left) showed severely dilated RV, apical hypokinesis and McConnell's sign. PERT code was activated and pt was taken for stat CTA (image 3) revealing massive #Pulmonaryembolism (?saddle) but predominately occluding the entire R side. Systemic thrombolysis was considered, however, pt had known meningioma, which showed interval growth on stat CT head, raising concern for bleed. Within 4h of presentation, pt was taken to IR suite for embolectomy, which was successful at restoring flow to entire R lung field (image 4).
